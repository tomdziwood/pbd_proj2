Review 29428 for listing 6369 by Nancy (84790) on 2010-03-14:"Simon and Arturo have the ultimate location in Madrid!  Steps from the Metro and bus line to everywhere you want to visit.  The accomodations are clean, well appointed and fantastic views of Madrid skyline.  We felt like it was a spa when walking into the flat.  We were greeted warmly and offered lots of information to get up and running for our short stay.  We wished we could have stayed longer and we highly recommend this location and neighborhood."
Review 31018 for listing 6369 by David (84338) on 2010-03-23:"Myself and Kristy originally planned on staying with Arturo for only a week, but when our plans changed, Arturo was very open to working with our changing schedule. Arturo and Simon were very friendly and helpful throughout our ten day visit. Our room was very clean and well kept. The view is amazing and the location is perfect. We're going to be traveling around Europe for another four months, and were joking that Arturo set the standards so high that we highly doubt we're going to be able to do any better, and it's true! Thank you so much Arturo and Simon, you were both very gracious, helpful and respectful of our space. I would highly recommend you and your flat to anyone traveling who wants a quite place with a great views, wonderful/clean rooms, a respectful and honest atmosphere. Thank you so much for being such an outstanding host! "

It's a wonderful room and bath in a great apartment with a lovely terrace. The location is perfect for me, especially given the easy access to the the Metro and the airport.  I look forward to returning!

Review 41548 for listing 6369 by Deborah (95579) on 2010-05-10:"Perfect airbnb experience as all others say. Lots of reasonable cafes or places to buy prepared food to eat at home in area. Room with terrace and ensuite prefect. Easy to get to from airport and to go all around Madrid on the metro. Arturo and Simon are the perfect hosts, helpful and hospitable (loved Simons mint tea and thanks for use of computer and internet) but also you feel you have lots of privacy. "
Review 42550 for listing 6369 by Nina (106586) on 2010-05-15:"Great host, great apartment! I had the bath to myself which was great. Neighborhood is safe and clean. Convenient store, bank, coffee shop and tapas bar nearby. It's so close you can crawl to it. Overall a great experience:) Also glad there is an elevator. "
Review 45278 for listing 6369 by Bo (112662) on 2010-05-23:We had a wonderful time in Madrid and the stay at ArturoÂ´s place is recommendable! Especially the terrace is a hit.
Review 45618 for listing 6369 by Charde (18688) on 2010-05-24:"We only stayed here for one night unfortunately, but it was superb value for money. Clean, sunny and spacious with welcoming hosts. It is not in the city centre, but Madrid is easily navigated with the metro, so that isn't really an issue!

Would definitely recommend!"
Review 57074 for listing 6369 by Y. S. (134713) on 2010-06-25:"Great room in non-touristy location.  Convenient to the metro and has lots of tapas bars, bakeries, etc. nearby."
Review 58370 for listing 6369 by Derek (103204) on 2010-06-28:"Arturo and Simon were extremely welcoming to my girlfriend and I during our trip to Madrid. The proximity of his apartment to the airport, and the air conditioning are big pluses in our book. Also, having traveled elsewhere around Spain, having an elevator is also a big plus. The rate was extremely affordable, and Arturo definitely deserves the five star rating on this site. 

Two things to keep in mind when booking. First, while the Madrid metro is extremely convenient, Arturo's apartment isn't close to downtown Madrid. This may not matter to you, but as young-ish first time travelers to Madrid, we had some late nights coming back to the apartment. Despite that, I thought that being close to the airport was a nice compromise.

Also, there isn't a lock on the door. This wasn't a huge deal for my girlfriend and me (hence the 5 star rating), but if that's going to bother you, keep it in mind. "
Review 93562 for listing 6369 by Rachel (142487) on 2010-09-09:"Arturo and Simon were the most welcoming and accomadating hosts ever.  The apartment was beautiful and well maintained, the access from the metro was handy and just on the doorstep. The roof top terrace was amazing and the bedroom was spacious and comfortable. When we visit Madrid again we will definitely stay there. "
Review 95547 for listing 6369 by Hanzel (105946) on 2010-09-12:"Hello, great location and amazing space!! The metro is easy to get to the flat, thank you Arturo for having me stay in your flat. All the best Hanzel Moreno"
Review 97782 for listing 6369 by Carlos (212797) on 2010-09-15:"There is no better place to stay if you are visiting Madrid. The metro station is 30 yards from the entrance of the building. If you prefer to take the bus, the bus stop is across the street. Either way it takes 15 minutes to downtown Madrid. The neighborhood is great, with bars and restaurants close by, but also quiet at night. We stayed  at the bigger room that has a private bathroom. It was as good as staying in a high scale hotel, with the convenience of having more space. The apartment is terrific. The terrace is wonderful. Finally and most importantly, Arturo is a great host, willing to answer any question and willing to give you tips to make your stay in Madrid outstanding. Thanks you so much!"
Review 105993 for listing 6369 by Leigh (51776) on 2010-09-27:"It couldn't have been better. The room and terasse were lovely, clean, with a comfortable bed, and were convenient to everything. Arturo and Simon are completely marvelous as well. I enjoy both of them very much and only regret living so far away that I will not be able to visit them frequently. I will certainly recommend this room to anyone visiting Madrid."
Review 115173 for listing 6369 by Holly & Tyler (159607) on 2010-10-10:"We stayed with Arturo and Simon and had a very pleasant stay. While we did not meet Arturo (we kept missing like ships in the night) we were welcomed and entertained by Simon. This is a great place to stay if you are looking to stay in a more ""real"" neighbourhood that is light on tourists and heavy on locals. There is a great market nearby for coffee, tortilla espagnola, and lots of fresh veggies and the like. The room was great - airy, comfortable, and pleasantly connected to a bathroom. "
Review 118924 for listing 6369 by Evi&Hugo (184176) on 2010-10-14:"My boyfriend Hugo and I had a wonderful stay with Arturo! Right away, he welcomed us with hot coffee and a quick chat. He was kind and helpful throughout our stay, and the room was large and clean, with a great newly remodeled bathroom. Perhaps the best part is the location! It's a direct shot to the airport on the pink metro line, just a few stops, and then again very easy to get to the center for all the tourist sites. There's also a great large indoor food market just across the street, and a shop where you can buy hot food to go (El Sabroso). We bought a large roasted chicken, croquettes, an entire Spanish tortilla, and green peas for just 12 euros, and had an amazing feast on the terrace right outside our room. Highly recommended!"
Review 131856 for listing 6369 by Pascale (185723) on 2010-11-02:"Nice place to stay. 
It's close to the subway to go to the center, direct line to the airport (15-20min).
The room is nice with a big bathroom ... the weather was not that good to enjoy the terrasse but it should be wonderfull to take the breakfast if the weather is sunny.
We strongly recommend :-)"
Review 138625 for listing 6369 by Jordan (271439) on 2010-11-14:Best place to stay in Madrid. Love tbe rooftop views. Very friendly hosts. Right next to the subway stop which makes it very convenient. Great neighborhood with great eats. 
Review 145579 for listing 6369 by Laura (257278) on 2010-11-28:"Arturo and Simon were excellent hosts.  It was my first time staying at an airbnb location and I'll be sure to use it in the future because of what a great experience it was.  Mi novio y yo had a wonderful vacation.
The most important thing was that Arturo and Simon were friendly and hospitable.  It was like I was a regular renter and could use the apartment as I liked.  At first I felt a bit uneasy about this since it wasn't my home, but by the last couple of days I finally felt like I lived there.  Next time I will feel more at home from the beginning.  
Also, the place was quiet and allowed for a good sleep after a day of meandering around Madrid.  
There were places to eat nearby but we usually went out to places recommended to us by (Hidden by Airbnb) or a tour book.  Do not forget to ask Arturo or Simon about the market nearby.  
There is a public phone and an ATM in front of the building as well as the metro access available right across the street.  It was very convenient.  "
Review 150241 for listing 6369 by Carolina (199871) on 2010-12-07:"We got to Madrid on a holiday and we could not have the chance to meet Arturo and his couple. We  found a very nice appartment the room was big and the bed comfy :) We got there on winter so we did not use the terrace that in summer time I bet is great!  
Arturo was very nice when I contacted him to reserve the room and actually he was giving me some advices about where to eat in Madrid. We definitely want to go back if we go to Madrid again soon.. "
Review 172479 for listing 6369 by E. Alex (326460) on 2011-01-19:"Arturo was an absolute sweetheart! We arrived half an hour later than expected and he was still around to greet us. The room was clean, the bed extremely comfortable for two and the bathroom was by far the largest we had ever stayed (in Europe).  Despite the cold, the rooftop terrace was gorgeous and very comfortable. Arturo was kind enough to let us use the washer and was always very helpful. The apt itself is about a 25-30 minute bus trek, but in a very scenic and comfortable route. Would absolutely love to stay again! "
Review 189700 for listing 6369 by Bob (353655) on 2011-02-28:"What can I say that hasn't been already said about Arturo's place.  He is a warm, welcoming and considerate host.  For anyone who is new to Madrid, he is helpful about answering any questions and providing local knowledge to make your visit more enjoyable.  The neighborhood is great and has many local shops and markets.  If you are looking for a place to work out, ask Arturo for directions to the local public fitness facility - 4.50 euros for a clean, well equipped  gym about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. Staying here made us feel like we were living more like a local and away from the tourist/business crowds you find at the more typical hotel facilities. The room is perfect - big, bright and airy with a huge remodeled bathroom.  We had several lovely night sitting on the terrace drinking wine and taking in the Madrid night sky.  The subway is literally outside your door which connects easily you to any part of the city - including the Bajaras airport (super convenient). If you don't book here you are missing out on the best deal in Madrid!
Muchas gracias, Arturo."

They have a beautifully appointed apartment, well stocked and very clean. The terrace is gorgeous, my wife and I had several meals outside. It was also in a very convenient area. It is, as Arturo and Simon say, quite literally 10 steps to their door from the metro. Thanks Again! "
Review 232786 for listing 6369 by Geoffrey (379974) on 2011-04-20:"We enjoyed our stay in Arturo's Rooftop Terrasse room.  Arturo and Simon made us very welcome.  The facilities were very clean, neat and well-maintained.  The bathroom especially was modern and roomy.  It was delightful to be able to have our meals on the terrace.  We appreciated being able to have access to the apartment's laundry.  The location was very satisfactory, with access to the city centre by the Metro station just over the road from the accommodation.  The neighbourhood was both quiet and interesting."
Review 240416 for listing 6369 by Chi Chi (393135) on 2011-04-26:"Our stay with aurturo and simon was wonderful! The room was more than we expected and would rival any room in a top end hotel. The terrace was a lovely addition, it was nice waking up to sunshine. The apartment is super close to the columbia metro stn which takes you dt in less than half hour. It is also conveniently close to the airport as well.
Both hosts were fabulous and they made our stay comfortable and enjoyable :) thank you!"
Review 253678 for listing 6369 by Angela (186485) on 2011-05-06:"Excellent place in Madrid! Arturo and Simon were great hosts. The room has a very comfortable bed (best sleep we've had in weeks), a huge bathroom and a beautiful terrace. Subway station right at the door (in nice area) with direct access to the airport. Would definitely stay with Arturo if we're back in Madrid!"
Review 266915 for listing 6369 by Marc (529463) on 2011-05-16:It was a pleasure to stay at Arturo's place. The room and bathroom are clean and spacious and the terrace is perfect for having breakfast in the morning. The location of the apartment is a bit far from the center by foot but the metro station is really close. There are however a bunch of clubs 5 min away if you want to go out in the neighborhood.
Review 278110 for listing 6369 by Tim (341324) on 2011-05-24:"The apartment was great with access to the Metro just outside the front door of the building.  Arturo provided literature about Madrid to assist in locating and planning various venues.  The room with private bath was first class and the bathroom was large with a very large shower.  The use of the kitchen allowed meals to be prepared thereby reducing the overall cost of the stay.  The terrace was a plus for the apartment.  The room was clean, neat and tastefully decorated.  I would stay with Arturo again when in Madrid."
Review 284115 for listing 6369 by Kaiser (145586) on 2011-05-27:"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Arturo's top floor apartment. He is very kind and accomodating. The room and bathroom are very comfortable, clean and large. The best part is the access to patio, we enjoyed evenings there. He gave us information on the city as well. He helped me park my car as well. there is a Metro station in the same block.  I will stay again in a heartbeat. "
Review 301653 for listing 6369 by Beate (359010) on 2011-06-07:"We had a great time at Arturo's place. The roof terrace was overwhelming, Arturo was very nice with all his tipps and recommendations.

Beate and Traute"
Review 311551 for listing 6369 by Joel (251582) on 2011-06-13:"Great place, wonderful host.  Bedroom has its own (big) bathroom and access to the terrace (as photos show).  Metro is literally outside the building.  It's a bit of a ride to downtown (two connections to get to Puerta del Sol) but it's easy enough -- I don't think you can find a place of equal quality and value close to the center.  If you're a nightowl and tend to stay out late (Metro closes at 1:30am), I am told there's a nightbus from downtown (or you can always take the taxi -- around 14 euro).  I would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Madrid."
Review 325909 for listing 6369 by Sebastien (360220) on 2011-06-21:"Very good experience. My wife and I stayed at Arturo's for 7 nights and we will repeat that experience anytime. The location is great although a little far from the city center (but close to the airport and Madrid's subway is great). The room is large with a nice bathroom, the terrace is amazing and Arturo's friend who were also staying there during  our stay (Rafa and Anniel) were very friendly. That helped us to really appreciate Madrid. Muy buena calidad a buen precio. "

Review 339699 for listing 6369 by Jenn (492709) on 2011-06-28:"Arturo was on vacation but his roommate Rafa was an great host and an excellent guy. We really enjoyed hanging out with him.  The room was beautiful - hardwood floors, air conditioning, firm bed, garden terrace, private two sink bathroom.  Location was next to the Columbia train line which during the weekend takes about 20 min to get to Plaza del sol.  Would definitely stay there again."
Review 353275 for listing 6369 by Norman (448298) on 2011-07-05:"My visit to Madrid was spectacular, and the stay at Arturo place was extremely comfortable......when booking it would be very fesible to select the room with the restroom attached...that was convient.

The bathroom was huge, the bedroom was really nice and comfortable and we were able to do your washing which was great. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and has some really great restaurants. All up we had a great time, Arturo was an excellent host he spoke clear english and booked us a taxi to the airport. Would definitely stay here again.  "
Review 579796 for listing 6369 by Jean (556748) on 2011-09-29:"The place was simply perfect. 

Arturo was away, but his friend Rafa was a very generous and friendly  host. My stay  was everything one could wish for; a well appointed, air conditionned and above all quiet  room with a full bathroom and, of course, the terrace which was such a plus. 

I was tempted to write an awful review just to keep this wonderful place a secret for myself, my  friends and relatives ;-) but that would have been unfair. 

So, yes, I highly recommend the Rooftop terrace room of Arturo.

Review 605342 for listing 6369 by John And Nathan (184042) on 2011-10-07:"Thank you so much for this wonderful place to stay.  Arturo and Simon were away so we didn't get to meet them, but Rafa and Aniel were perfect hosts.  The apartment is convenient for everything and is in a very nice neighborhood with a beautiful market and good restaurants.  The apartment is exactly as described and is quiet and comfortable.  Really excellent and highly recommended."
Review 627473 for listing 6369 by Christian (874563) on 2011-10-14:"During our first trip to Madrid, we spent five nights in this beautiful bedroom. The spacious bathroom and the brilliant terrace were a big plus. The apartment is situated in a pleasant neighbourhood. We enjoyed the ""chocolateria Lyon"" just round the corner as a cosy place for having breakfast. Rafa and Aniel were warm-hearted and helpful hosts. We highly recommend this place and hope to return soon again."
Review 641151 for listing 6369 by Eric (272881) on 2011-10-18:"We stayed in this room two times during our recent trip to Spain for a total of 9-nights.  The apartment is located just steps to the nearest metro station.  This is ideal if you're doing an airport transfer as it is just a few more stops on the same train line to the international airport.  While most tourist sights will be a short train ride away we found this neighborhood to be pleasantly Spanish.  Without hotels there aren't many other tourists around.  Within a one-block radius you'll find a dozen good restaurants, a grocery store, a bakery, and a huge Spanish market with dozens of vendors selling cured meat, raw meat, fish, cheese, produce, and more.  There is a park a short walk away. Arturo was out of town when we visited so his roommate Rafa welcomed us in.  Simply put, Rafa is the best roommate you could ask for.  He is exceedingly friendly and we really liked him.   This room has fast wifi, a big comfortable bed, a door to the very large shared terrace, and a large en-suite bathroom.  There's also a good air conditioning unit in your room.  The bedroom is very quiet, no traffic noise, no neighbors, but you can hear some noise from the elevator when it is moved.  Arturo has left out some maps, guides, and outlet adaptors if you need them. We really enjoyed our time here.  We would recommend this room to anyone and everyone and would stay here again too.  "
