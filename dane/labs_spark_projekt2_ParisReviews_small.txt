Review 208779822 for listing 3109 by Patricia (4142888) on 2017-11-03:"Un petit nid fouiller douillet situé dans  appartement tranversant, très lumineux avec une fenêtre dans chaque piece! Situé au 4ème étage, sans ascenseur, même après une bonne journée de marche ne nous a pas paru pénalisant. Mais au contraire, dès l'entrée dans l'appartement,  une belle décoration, très confortable, bien équipé, un VRAI lit en 160cm digne de se nom vous, bous fera oublié les marchés montées....un vrai airbnb, où Anne nous confie son lieux de vie en toute confiance. 
Notre hôtes a été très réactive et nous a facilité notre séjour pour tous les points demandés.
Nous reviendrons chez Anne c'est sur si l'occasion se présente à nous.
 Merci encore."

Review 4824 for listing 5396 by Sarah (19995) on 2009-06-30:"Perfect location!! Nasrine was a delight and made the whole process very easy. We also had a problem with construction noise, but it's good that they're doing some upkeep on the building. Thanks for a lovely stay in Paris. We'll be back!"
Review 4968 for listing 5396 by Chris (20117) on 2009-07-03:"This is a nice place in a great location in Paris, and the woman helping the owner was very kind to us. Thanks for helping my brother and his wife have a great time."
Review 5240 for listing 5396 by Annelaure (22190) on 2009-07-08:"Nice studio, very clean, very quiet, in a great neighbourhood. Close to everything and very safe. The only down thing for me was that they were in the process of renovating the building and there were loud construction workers at my window starting at 8AM. For the rest, it was perfect."
Review 9619 for listing 5396 by Jean (11947) on 2009-09-10:"Superb location, great studio. 
A slice of Paris that is the real thing. 
Wonderful host. Friendly merchants, (we needed a corkscrew and the neighboring restaurant uncorked our bottle, on our way to an evening picnic along La Seine.

Review 18970 for listing 5396 by Bette (40625) on 2009-12-02:"Perfect place to be in Paris, walking home every night past Notre Dame and across the river through the old streets of the Ile St. Louis. The studio is just right- attractive, immaculate, with everything you could need."
Review 25574 for listing 5396 by Amy (50781) on 2010-02-07:"Wonderful hosts - very accommodating, friendly and responsive. The apartment was perfectly situated and very comfortable furnished. It was exactly as described. Thank you!"
Review 38642 for listing 5396 by Amy (106430) on 2010-04-28:"Best location in Paris - very privy location and walking distance to everything! The apartment is small but perfect for one or two persons. Away from the street, it is very quiet and renovated with modern features. The sofa bed is extremely comfortable! I felt like a local staying there."
Review 46432 for listing 5396 by Suzanne (46034) on 2010-05-26:"Just a short walk from several Metro stations, Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville, left bank, thus central to any destination in Paris; great bakery, wine, and cheese shops steps away. Lots of foot traffic on the weekends, but the the apartment is quiet and private. Small but well set up. Couldn't ask for better."
Review 53866 for listing 5396 by Charles (69258) on 2010-06-17:"I can not imagine a better location to stay in Paris.  And the value of this apartment is outstanding. Small efficiency apt. but good use of space, tasteful, well stocked (Internet, telephone etc.). Psychologically comfortable, looking out large windows on inner courtyard, which makes the space feel larger. Neighborhood 17th/18th century stone buildings; classy and quiet. Nasrine was helpful and kind."
Review 92977 for listing 5396 by Martin (36827) on 2010-09-08:"I always stay on the Ile Saint Louis when I am in Paris (where I spend 4-6 weeks per year every summer) and so I knew that the location is just perfect for me! Some say the Ile Saint Louis is too touristy in summer, but Borzou's studio is on the quiter, eastern half of the tiny island in the Seine - which is really like a small 17th century village. 

The studio is exactly as advertised:  perfectly located, quiet, 100% updated, small but with all the creature comforts: an A+ ""American"" kitchen w/ a washing machine, flat screen TV w/ cable, wireless Internet connection and a phone w/ free calls from landline to landline. The studio is in the back of a restored building up 2 flights of 17th century wooden stairs.

Within a ONE minute walk is a post office, pharmacy, small supermarket, bakery, butcher - and, of course, loads of restaurants. The Metro (Line 7, the 'pink' line) at Pont-Marie is a FIVE minute walk across the Pont Marie. I am looking forward to my next visit!"
Review 120447 for listing 5396 by Ruta (117667) on 2010-10-17:"Great studio in a perfect location. In the very center of old Paris and all things but very quiet. Very well set-up with wi-fi, washer, and a full kitchen. A Metro station is nearby but we found it was walking distance to everything. The host was warm and welcoming. 

Overall, a wonderful experience.  Highly recommended.

Review 232617 for listing 5396 by Marianne (176451) on 2011-04-20:"Fantastic location, quiet, clean, great place for 2 people.  Host is responsive to questions in a timely manner.  Kitchen has everything you need and things work well."
Review 249396 for listing 5396 by Jeanne (366200) on 2011-05-03:"If you will be out all day sight-seeing in Paris, then this apartment can be a fine rental. It's re-finish is contemporary. The pull-out bed is comfortable. The wi-fi works. It's located on the quiet end of a busy tourist street. There is plenty to do and see within walking distance and 5 minutes from the Metro.

If you think you'll be spending some time hanging out in the apartment, note that there aren't any views out the windows, which look out onto a small courtyard, and, most likely, you'll want to keep the shades drawn for privacy. "
Review 261539 for listing 5396 by Kelly (330028) on 2011-05-13:"My boyfriend and I stayed here last May.  This location is hard to beat.  Perfect location - We only used the metro two or three times during our week stay.  The apartment was cozy and comfortable for two.  Nasrine met us with the keys upon our arrival.  She was very nice and made us feel at home.  Borzou was also very helpful in his communication including restaurant recommendations, sights to see, along with other helpful and practical information for our stay.  Thank you!"
Review 281553 for listing 5396 by Laura (110315) on 2011-05-26:Cozy apartment in a great location!  I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Paris.
Review 336485 for listing 5396 by William (266395) on 2011-06-27:"A wonderful experience! The studio was exactly as the pictures described. we were met on time by gracious Nazerine, and made to feel at home.
A perfect location, yet quiet and relaxing. It was a true home away from home. We can't wait to go back!"
Review 368033 for listing 5396 by Catherine (451974) on 2011-07-12:"As virtually all the reviews note, the apartment is in a great location, clean and quiet.  Highly recommended despite the sofa bed now deeply impregnated with many previous bodies and very old thin pillows. However, perhaps this is part of the value for money equation-- in all other respects the apartment is fantastic. There is also a good range of travel/guide books on Paris in the apartment. "
Review 757080 for listing 5396 by Dana (247117) on 2011-12-01:"Amazing in every way! (Location, amenities, host, etc..)   I loved walking home every day down the narrow streets of the island. Highly recommended - you will love it!"
Review 787726 for listing 5396 by Steve (1221812) on 2011-12-16:I had a great stay in Borzou's apartment; the location was such that I used the Metro much less than on previous visits to Paris.  I will definetly try to arrange another stay here as well as AIRBNB facilities in other locales.  
Review 808604 for listing 5396 by Tania (1496105) on 2011-12-27:"Perfect studio in a prefect location!
It was so quiet, which was important for me to be able to work, write and rest. It was also an easy walk to all the tourist highlights and the many great restaurants and bars. Overall a great hideaway in the middle of it all, and a wonderful introduction to a charming city! 
Thanks for allowing me to stay in the studio ... I will certainly be back. "
Review 888139 for listing 5396 by Dayne (1184082) on 2012-01-29:"An amazing studio with everything you need, wonderful location and very private, quiet and clean.  A peaceful oasis of calm in the busy Paris centre.  The apartment is extremely warm and cosy, has a brilliant washing machine and kitchen, great shower, and beautiful view out into the square courtyard of the building, very calm and relaxing, it has a very good feeling.  I would highly recommend this apartment.  This was my first time using the airbnb site and I was most impressed with what I experienced.  Thank you to Nasrine for being such a lovely host with a very warm and honest manner.  I want to stay again soon!!"
Review 948534 for listing 5396 by Kim (1382295) on 2012-02-26:"I had a peaceful 3-week stay in Borzou's cozy studio. Compared to other studio apartments I've stayed in in Paris, this one has enough space and is set up to function really well. As well, the pull-out bed is comfortable. It's a quiet building, and a quiet area of the city except on weekends. The location is fantastic for exploring both right and left banks on foot; metro lines are close. 
The only problem I had was that I lost my cell phone connection while in the apartment, as did my friends who came to visit. But there's also a phone line, and wifi in the apartment :) 
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can recommend staying at Borzou's studio!"
Review 1017000 for listing 5396 by Katrina (1671095) on 2012-03-19:"I stayed at Borzou's flat for 10 days in March and couldn't have asked for a thing. All was perfect! The apartment is exactly as pictured: clean, and comfortable, while the linens are fresh and the neighborhood quiet. While I was usually out during the day, evenings in the flat were always peaceful and relaxing. 

But, what I liked most was the location! Situated on the I'le St. Louis, you are perfectly located between the Left and Right Banks. Everything you could need (ATM, boulangerie, fromagerie, market, metro, restaurants, and shopping) is just minutes away. An ice cream from the Berthillon window is a fun evening ritual and I highly recommend a visit to the church across the street for a concert. I enjoyed a beautiful Bach concert one night and it was one of the many highlights of my visit. But, equally important, is that females traveling alone can feel safe here. Regardless of whether it was day or night, I always felt at ease, whether within the apartment or walking around the neighborhood. 

Finally, the communication from both Borzou and Nasrine is prompt, reliable and very helpful! Nasrine, who will likely welcome you, is a delight and helps you feel right at home! Travel guides and maps in the apartment are a blessing. And, if you're lucky, the previous guest has left some snacks and wine, a bonus when you arrive exhausted and just want to relax!

Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Should I find myself in Paris again, this would be the first place I looked!"
Review 1089529 for listing 5396 by Jessica (1826090) on 2012-04-06:"I visit Paris for a few weeks each year, and I typically stay in this neighborhood because it is such an excellent location - an easy walk to either bank of the Seine.  The particular flat is rather small, but if you don't mind the tight quarters, it has everything you'd need, and it is arranged to maximize the use of the space.  The bed, even though it is a sofa-bed, it very comfortable (I was there for more than 2 weeks).  There is laundry in the unit, which is quite convenient.  This is the perfect place for 1 person for a longer stay, or two people for a shorter stay (unless they really love eachother, and can stand the close quarters for longer)."
Review 1147535 for listing 5396 by Lucia (1764705) on 2012-04-18:"We had a really great time at Borzou's  apartment. Everything worked very well. The location is simply awsome and this helped us a lot to enjoying Paris the way we did. Definitely I would stay there again next time I go to Paris.

Review 2125933 for listing 5396 by Jennifer (1996427) on 2012-08-28:This was my second stay at Borzou's apartment.  It's the perfect spot right in the heart of the city.  Everything you could need right at your doorstep! Love it!
Review 2874171 for listing 5396 by Tracy M. (2853337) on 2012-11-13:"Location! Location! Location! This is the perfect little place right in the center of Paris. My 5 weeks stay allowed me to explore a lot of Paris, and mostly by foot. When I did take the Metro (only 3x) there were two lines within walking distance. I loved being able to step over the bridge on one side into The Latin Quarters and on the other side into The Marais. Many of the main attractions for tourist are within walking distance, and if you are there for a longer stay, the central location makes it great for going outside the touristy areas.

The apartment was great for coming back to after all-day explorations. I also spent a lot of time inside working, as well as relaxing. While there are tons and tons of places to eat, the apartment has a great little kitchen that I made use of. There is a laundromat just a few steps away from the apartment, so packing light is not a problem. There is a washer in the apartment (no dryer) so wash-and-hang clothes work best. For women traveling alone this is a very safe area. On the weekends the island has a little more foot traffic (there are so many great shops) than on the weekdays - and especially on Mondays, it is very quiet and peaceful.

The apartment is great for a romantic getaway or for a single person looking for a retreat. My stay at the flat was memorable and I hope to return to this little island that I now consider my home away from home."
Review 2945210 for listing 5396 by Emma (1910741) on 2012-11-23:A beautiful flat in a great location - everything was exactly as described! 
Review 3410050 for listing 5396 by Timothy (4125429) on 2013-01-25:"This apartment is in such a wonderful location!! Right in the heart of everything - you can walk to Saint Germain des Pres, Notre Dame, the Louvre! It is such a picturesque little island in the heart of Paris. A number of metro stops are close by, so getting to other places is really easy. The apartment itself is a studio - but very comfortable and cosy - complaints from us! Thank you Borzou and Co. We had a wonderful time. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Paris."
Review 3523932 for listing 5396 by Laura (3527541) on 2013-02-12:"This studio flat on Ile-St-Louis is in an excellent location. Two underground stations are close, so you can get anywhere in the city quite easily. The apartment is in an older building, reached by a narrow, winding staircase, but it has been renovated to modern standards. Amenities include security-enabled wireless, combination microwave/conventional oven, washing machine, single-handled faucets, desk and chair, nice towels. Recycling is encouraged. 
I had a poor introduction though: my first two nights were very disturbed due to loud noises from the flat above – scraping, banging, clattering, dragging furniture and loud voices went on until 1:30 in the morning. After the first two nights, everything was fine, so I must have just been unlucky at the beginning.
For privacy, you need to keep the drapes closed, so the room can seem closed-in.
All in all, it was a comfortable, safe place to stay. Recommended.

Review 4372445 for listing 5396 by Shannon K (378730) on 2013-05-01:"The studio apartment is small but just fine for two. Elaheh, their aunt, met us and she is lovely lady, she told us about the apartment and the neighborhood. We never could get the oven going but everything else worked fine and lots of hot water. 
Location,location, (Website hidden by Airbnb) is great!!! I highly recommend this

Review 5031715 for listing 5396 by Paul (3657859) on 2013-06-09:"Borzou's apartment was certainly a perfect location for our stay in Paris, we were close to many markets and so could buy meat, fish, vegetables, cheese,and fruit, etc as we wished. It was nice to be able to prepare our own meals. Highly recommend for an extended break in Paris."
Review 5288408 for listing 5396 by Jan (1551456) on 2013-06-23:"Mum and son bunked in together on the settee for 8 days of a great stay in Paris. We loved staying on the island. It is an oasis in the busy-ness of Paris. The studio is very efficient to live in with everything at your fingertips.The kitchen is very easy to use and supplies are shared from other stayers and the owners in good trust. There is an excellent bar up the corner for happy hour to watch the folks sashay from the Marais to the Latin behind Notre Dame. The boulangerie, wine shop, butcher and co are steps away and the local restaurants are quite ok too. Highly recommended to stay here and I hope to be back! "
Review 5671354 for listing 5396 by Kent (2909529) on 2013-07-11:"There are so many great parts of this apartment. The location is phenomenal, with easy access to Metro (St. Paul and Pont Marie stops), great access to bakery and two different groceries, a produce market, and a high-end cheese shop. That's just to name the places we were most interested in! And not to mention, the best ice cream in Paris is less than a block away! 

The only drawback to the apartment is the storage space. We were staying for 8 days, and it would have been nice if there had been some more cabinet space to put our clothes. There is a closet with as many hangars as you could possibly need. We just hung all our clothes. But folded clothes (like undergarments) we had to keep on the bookshelf. Of course, this is really all I can think to comment on. The hot water is plentiful. The kitchen is stocked with glasses and plates. And the bed is comfortable. I highly recommend the apartment."

Review 8274946 for listing 5396 by Andrea Vittorio (2947980) on 2013-10-23:"Great apt for a couple! My girlfriend and i enjoyed the beautiful location, very confortable, easy access to Metro, so close to every kind of markets and to a fantastic boulangerie, just next to the apt. We loved staying on the island,far from the noise of the city. We were so close to the Louvre, Notre Dame, Le Marais, Les Halles, Latin quarter and more: The location is excellent. The apt is small but very comfortable with all the things you might need.The stairs are very small and narrow,it will be hard if you have heavy luggage!! Another negative point was the wifi not working,it would be very useful. All in all we absolutely recommend this apt, we would book it again!"
Review 8770703 for listing 5396 by Katherine (7389155) on 2013-11-17:"As previous travelers have observed, this flat is in a stellar location on the Ile St. Louis, across the street from a lovely old church. It was very clean, warm, well-lighted and quiet for our stay in mid November. It's definitely small -- those airbnb photographers know how to rock a wide-angle lens! -- but plenty of room for two people traveling light. A few other details: 1. It's on the 3rd floor (counted as the 2nd floor in France), up a very narrow, winding stairway. Make sure you can carry your bags up 3 flights. 2. The windows look out onto a very small inner courtyard that's a bit drab. 3. There's a phone in the room you can use to make free calls to many countries in Europe, the US and Canada -- could be a big bonus for some travelers. 4. Wifi had a good strong signal. Bottom line: Good price, great location, a few minor things to take into account. I'd definitely stay again."
Review 8998982 for listing 5396 by Ronald (9423450) on 2013-12-01:"Fantastic.  I've stayed in Paris many times but never on the Isle St Louis.  Small village amid the big city.  Walk the quais anytime.  The Studio flat fit me perfectly.  Clean, modern, yet allowed me to live in a traditional Paris building like a Parisian for 8 days, shopping at the markets, loved the supermarket  wine-- white Bordeaux, good reds for 5 euro a bottle or less ready made quiche, vol au vent, etc for a few euros. Walked everywhere.  Isle de Fous Restaurant is the equivalent of a French diner with its zinc countertop.  Was there for the Fete de Noel, another glorious first for me. (I don't want to recommend it too highly because I want to be able to go back the next time I'm in Paris). I was very pleased and staying there made my petite vacance memorable and it will be my first choice when I return.  The hosts were helpful & courteous.  Five star experience all around.
